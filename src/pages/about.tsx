      Inspiration: The idea behind SafeSwan was heavily influenced by our desire to create an informative website for people to feel secure in their daily lives. By providing a dedicated platform to inform people about the crimes in places they wanted to visit, specifically how to prepare if they wanted to visit a certain city. 

      What it does: The key features in our website are: pie chart showing ratio of crimes and type of crimes in a certain city, ranking out of five to show how safe a city is, displaying resources and non profit organizations for those who are victims or for those who want to help prevent crimes, as well as an AI-integrated chat bot, Sage, for users to ask questions about safety tips, cities, or anything else. 

      Built with
      Design: Figma
      Languages: Python, React, TypeScript, HTML/CSS, Tailwind CSS
      APIs: OpenAI
